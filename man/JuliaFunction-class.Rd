}
\description{
A class and generator function for proxies in R for Julia functions.
}
\details{
An object from this class is an R function that is a proxy for a function in Julia. Calls to the R function evaluate
a call to the Julia function.  The arguments in the call are converted to equivalent Julia objects;
these typically include proxy objects for results previously computed through the XRJulia interface.
}
\arguments{
\item{name, module}{The name and module of the Julia function.}
\item{evaluator}{The evaluator object to use.  By default, and usually, the current evaluator
is used, and one is started if none has been.}
\item{...}{For \code{RJulia}, the arguments as interpreted by the
    initialize method, so typically \code{name} and optionally
    \code{module}.  Remaining arguments are passed along to the next method.}
}
